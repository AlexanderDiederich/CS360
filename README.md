Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The event tracker app is a calendar app that allows its users to add events, and set reminders for those events. The main goal of this application is to allow its users to stay organized and be able to see all the events that they have coming up. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I had five screens for this app, they were login, register user, the event display, adding a new event, and sms permission. The ui design was developed with the thought about the users in mind, and was designed to be navigated easily by its users.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The process that I chose to follow when writing the code for this project was to think about the users wants and needs. I wanted to ensure that the app was user friendly and would need little training on how it was to be used. I knew the things that I wanted to add and just slowly added everything until I was finished. I will apply this in the future by taking the time to plan out even more of what I want to develop and the process that I am going to follow. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used an emulator to see if the code functioned the way that I needed it to. The reason that this is an important part of the process is because of the fact that if we release applications with code that does not work, we are liable to have more issues then if we test to fix them before launch. Finding errors before the app is released is a better way to get more people to use our app from the start. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to think of a way to get everything that I believed I needed and to do this I had to make five seperate screens. The most challenging part was figuring out how to make the project user friendly and simple to design. After some time spent thinking I made the UI design as simple as I could and then just made some tweeks from there.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think designing the UI was the easiest part to finish. I thought that it was going to be challenging because I had never done it but after working on the layout I was really enjoyed it due to it being less complicated than coding at least in my opinion.
